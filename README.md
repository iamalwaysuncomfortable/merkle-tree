## Merkle Tree proof of concept

This is a proof of concept for Worldcoin technical assessment surrounding 
Merkle Tree proofs. This exercise was timed so some solutions aren't %100 optimal
but desired outputs have been achieved.

### Usage

The merkle test logic is within the `src/exercises.rs` file and contains several
tests with associated test data. The tests can be run with `cargo test` after 
navigating the home directory.
